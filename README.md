# STA215
This is my final porject for my STA215 class where I analyzied the scenes throughout the TV show "Dexter" by using different varibles. I analyzed the duration of a scene, the amount of dead bodies on a scene, rather there was a crime committed during the scene, and if the crime was solved throughout the scene. 
# Instructions 
To utilize the scripit, open "project.R" where i contains the codes I ultized for my research. To acess the dataset, open "raw_data.csv" file. 
# Data 
The data collected focus on aspects of crime scenes. Thus measuring quantities variables such as dead bodies at a scene and the duration of a scene. Alongside qualitative variables such as if the crimes solved and if there was a crime was committed. The main goal of the analysis was to determin if a scene time is longer if it will increase the likelihood of a crime being solved. I anaylized the scenes on each time there was a new location (work, home, crime scene, other). After my data was collected I had 147 observation. 
# Operationalization
The concepet of crimes being solved was operationalized by the duration of a scene. In order to conduct if the crime is being solved in the scene I had four location (work, home, crime scenme other). I created a qualitative varible using 0=No 1=Yes. 

The concept of crime being commited was operalized by the duration of a scene. In order to conduct if a crime was solved in a scene I used four location (work, home, crime scenme other). I created a dummy varible using 0=No 1=Yes. 

The concept of the duration of a scene was operalized by how many sconds the scene is. In order to conduct this I used four location (work, home, crime scenme other). I would calcute the sceonds until there was a new location. I created a quantitative variable ranging from 2 up to 271 seconds. 

The concept of the number of dead bodies was operalized by the duration of a scene. In order to conduct the number of dead bodies in a scene I used four location (work, home, crime scenme other). I created a quantitative variable ranging from 0 up to 5.
